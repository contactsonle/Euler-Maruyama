# Euler-Maruyama

Euler Maruyama for numerical solution to SDE
This model assumes that volatility follows Heston Model and is trying to calculate Payoff of Asian Call Option.

NOTE: This code is slow and is made for analytical understanding of Brownian Motion simulation and how the framework works.
i.e. step-by-step code.

This code is helpful in helping understand how to replicate this method in a quicker language such as Java or C. Classes can be built based on commentaries.
